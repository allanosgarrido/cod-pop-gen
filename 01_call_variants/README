This directory contains one folder per species with all needed code to 
get called variants from .bam files from 00_input_data folder by using a
snakemake pipeline that is described within each folder in a /sm/README.md 
file. Basically, the pipeline was used to get interval files from the
reference genome (00_input_data/REFs/) and to genotype .bam files following
a parallelization approach according to these interval files. The variant 
caller that we used was GATK.

The pipeline rules, helper functions and scripts are intact from the github
repo https://github.com/harvardinformatics/shortRead_mapping_variantCalling
except in the case of Gmo. This species has that many samples that the
pipeline was not enough parallelized by using the interval lists within
/Gmo/sm/intervalFiles/gatkLists/. Thus, we further parallelized the pipeline
at the las step (i.e. DB2vcf). Further explanation about this modification
can be found at /Gmo/README

See the README files within each species directory for an explanation
about the status of each variant calling.
