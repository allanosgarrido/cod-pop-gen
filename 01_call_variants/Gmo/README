Variant calling status: incomplete. Current step: DB2vcf.
23 out of 52 interval lists are already genotyped.

An alternative DB2vcf step that further parallelizes the pipeline from there
onwards (according to interval names instead of interval lists) is being 
tested now. The script to do so is in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.

Once the test works, this readme file will be updated with the specifics of
such modification.
