Variant calling status: incomplete. Current step: DB2vcf.
23 out of 52 interval lists are already genotyped.

An alternative DB2vcf step that further parallelizes the pipeline from there
onwards (according to interval names instead of interval lists) is being 
tested now. The script to do so is /sm/DB2vcf_try.sh and the putative final
scripts are /sm/DB2vcf.sh and /sm/submit_DB2vcf.batch. The last one is meant
to submit one job to run DB2vcf.sh per interval name within each interval
list in /sm/intervalFiles/gatkLists/

Once the test works, this readme file will be updated with the specifics of
such modification.

This folder does not include the ./sm/gatk/ directory (in its github version).
which contains the data that is needed to continue variant calling. To copy
the symlinks to this data, run the cp.sh script located within this folder.
